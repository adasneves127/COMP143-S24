# Assign 1 as the value for the variable a,
# 2 for the value for the variable b,
# and -1 for the variable c.
# Calculate b^2 - 4ac by hand.
# Now use Python to check your answer.

# Assign 0 as the value for the variable a.
# Explain what it means to change the value of
# a from the previous problem, given that a variable
# references a value. (It is a label for a value.)

# Changing the value of a variable will change what
# value is referenced after the re-definition.

# What is the remainder when any even number is divided by 2?
# Illustrate your answer in Python using the  remainder operator
# (also known as the modulus or mod operator) in various examples.
